Testing Modules
===============

.. contents:: :local:

The rbeapi library provides spec tests. To run the spec tests, you will need to update the dut.conf file found in spec/fixtures. The switch used for testing should have at least interfaces Ethernet1-7.

    To run the spec tests, run bundle exec rspec spec from the root of the rbeapi source folder.
