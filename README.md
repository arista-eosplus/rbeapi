# Overview

The Ruby Client for eAPI provides a native Ruby implementation for programming Arista EOS network devices using Ruby.  The Ruby client provides the ability to build native applications in Ruby that can communicate with EOS either locally via Unix domain sockets (on-box) or remotely over a HTTP/S transport (off-box).  It uses a standard INI-style configuration file to specifiy one or more connection profiles.

The rbeapi implemenation also provides an API layer for building native Ruby objects that allow for configuration and state extraction of EOS nodes.  The API layer provides a consistent implementation for working with EOS configuration resources.  The implementation of the API layer is highly extensible and can be used as a foundation for building custom data models.

The libray is freely provided to the open source community for building robust applications using Arista EOS eAPI.  Support is provided as best effort through Github iusses.

## Requirements

* Arista EOS 4.12 or later
* Arista eAPI enabled for at least one transport (see official EOS Config Guide at arista.com for details)
* Ruby 1.9.3 or later

# Getting Started
In order to use rbeapi, the EOS command API must be enabled using ``management
api http-commands`` configuration mode.  This library supports eAPI calls over
both HTTP and UNIX Domain Sockets.  Once the command API is enabled on the
destination node, create a configuration file with the node properities. 

**Note:** The default search path for the conf file is ``~/.eapi.conf``
followed by ``/mnt/flash/eapi.conf``.  This can be overridden by setting
``EAPI_CONF=<path file conf file>`` in your environment.

## Example eapi.conf File
Below is an example of an eAPI conf file.  The conf file can contain more than
one node.  Each node section must be prefaced by **connection:\<name\>** where
\<name\> is the name of the connection.

The following configuration options are available for defining node entries:

* **host** - The IP address or FQDN of the remote device.  If the host
  parameter is omitted then the connection name is used
* **username** - The eAPI username to use for authentication (only required for
  http or https connections)
* **password** - The eAPI password to use for authentication (only required for
  http or https connections)
* **enablepwd** - The enable mode password if required by the destination node
* **transport** - Configures the type of transport connection to use.  The
  default value is _https_.  Valid values are:
    * socket (available in EOS 4.14.5 or later)
    * http_local (available in EOS 4.14.5 or later)
    * http
    * https  
* **port** - Configures the port to use for the eAPI connection.  A default
  port is used if this parameter is absent, based on the transport setting
using the following values:
    * transport: http, default port: 80
    * transport: https, deafult port: 443
    * transport: https_local, default port: 8080
    * transport: socket, default port: n/a
* **open_timeout** - The default number of seconds to wait for the eAPI
  connection to open. Any number may be used, including Floats for fractional
  seconds. Default value is 10 seconds.
* **read_timeout** - The default number of seconds to wait for one block of
  eAPI results to be read (via one read(2) call).  Any number may be used,
  including Floats for fractional seconds. Default value is 10 seconds.


_Note:_ See the EOS User Manual found at arista.com for more details on
configuring eAPI values.

All configuration values are optional. 

```
[connection:veos01]
username: eapi
password: password
transport: http

[connection:veos02]
transport: http

[connection:veos03]
transport: socket

[connection:veos04]
host: 172.16.10.1
username: eapi
password: password
enablepwd: itsasecret
port: 1234
transport: https

[connection:localhost]
transport: http_local
```

The above example shows different ways to define EOS node connections.  All
configuration options will attempt to use default values if not explicitly
defined.  If the host parameter is not set for a given entry, then the
connection name will be used as the host address.

### Configuring \[connection:localhost]

The rbeapi library automatically installs a single default configuration entry
for connecting to localhost host using a transport of sockets.  If using the
rbeapi library locally on an EOS node, simply enable the command API to use
sockets and no further configuration is needed for rbeapi to function.  If you
specify an entry in a conf file with the name ``[connection:localhost]``, the
values in the conf file will overwrite the default.

## Using rbeapi
The Ruby Client for eAPI was designed to be easy to use and implement for
writing tools and applications that interface with the Arista EOS management
plane.  

### Creating a connection and sending commands
Once EOS is configured properly and the config file created, getting started
with a connection to EOS is simple.  Below demonstrates a basic connection
using rbeapi.  For more examples, please see the examples folder.

```
# start by importing the library
require 'rbeapi/client'

# create a node object by specifying the node to work with
node = Rbeapi::Client.connect_to('veos01')

# send one or more commands to the node
node.enable('show hostname')
node.enable('show hostname')
=> [{:command=>"show hostname", :result=>{"fqdn"=>"veos01.arista.com", "hostname"=>"veos01"}, :encoding=>"json"}]

# use the config method to send configuration commands
node.config('hostname veos01')
=> [{}]

# multiple commands can be sent by using a list (works for both enable or config)

node.config(['interface Ethernet1', 'description foo'])
=> [{}, {}]

# return the running or startup configuration from the node (output omitted for brevity)

node.running_config

node.startup_config
```

### Using the API

The rbeapi library provides both a client for send and receiving commands over
eAPI as well as an API for working directly with EOS resources.   The API is
designed to be easy and straightforward to use yet also extensible.  Below is
an example of working with the ``vlans`` API

```
# create a connection to the node
require 'rbeapi/client'
node = Rbeapi::Client.connect_to('veos01')

# get the instance of the API (in this case vlans)
vlans = node.api('vlans')

# return all vlans from the node
vlans.getall
=> {"1"=>{:name=>"tester", :state=>"active", :trunk_groups=>[]},
 "4"=>{:name=>"VLAN0004", :state=>"active", :trunk_groups=>[]},
 "100"=>{:name=>"TEST_VLAN_100", :state=>"active", :trunk_groups=>[]},
 "300"=>{:name=>"VLAN0300", :state=>"active", :trunk_groups=>[]}}

# return a specific vlan from the node
vlans.get(1)
=> {:name=>"tester", :state=>"active", :trunk_groups=>[]}

# add a new vlan to the node
vlans.create(400)
=> true

# set the new vlan name
vlans.set_name(100, value: 'foo')
=> true
```

All API implementations developed by Arista EOS+ CS are found in the rbeapi/api
folder.  See the examples folder for additional examples.

# Installation

The source code for rbeapi is provided on Github at
http://github.com/arista-eosplus/rbeapi.  All current development is done in
the develop branch.  Stable released versions are tagged in the master branch
and uploaded to [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/).

* To install the latest stable version of rbeapi, simply run ``gem install rbeapi``
* To install the latest development version from Github, simply clone the
  develop branch and run

  ```
  $ rake build
  $ rake install
  ```

* To create an RPM, run ``rake rpm``
* To generate a SWIX file for EOS with necessary dependencies, run
  ``rake all_rpms`` then follow the ``swix create`` instructions, provided
  by the build.  NOTE: 
  [PuppetLabs](https://puppetlabs.com/misc/pe-files) provides a puppet agent SWIX which includes Ruby 1.9.3 in
  /opt/puppet/bin/ which is different from where you might otherwise install
  Ruby.  If you have installed the puppet-enterprise 3.x SWIX, then you should
  build and use the ``rbeapi-puppet3`` swix, below.   If you have installed
  the puppet-enterprise 2015.x SWIX, then you should build and use the
  ``rbeapi-puppet-aio`` swix, below.  Otherwise, if you have installed at least
  Ruby 1.9.3 in the standard system location, then the ``rbeapi`` SWIX may be
  used.

  ```
  $ bundle install --path .bundle/gems/
  $ bundle exec rake all_rpms
  ...
RPMs are available in rpms/noarch/
Copy the RPMs to an EOS device then run the 'swix create' command.
  Examples: 
    Puppet Open Source: 
      cd /mnt/flash; \
      swix create rbeapi-0.5.1-1.swix \

             rubygem-netaddr-puppet3-1.5.0-1.eos4.noarch.rpm
  -bash-4.1# exit
  Arista# copy flash:rbeapi-puppet3-0.5.1-1.swix extension:
  Arista# extension rbeapi-puppet3-0.5.1-1.swix
  Arista# copy installed-extensions boot-extensions
  ```

# Upgrading

  On EOS:
  ```
  Arista# no extension pe-rbeapi-0.3.0-1.swix
  Arista# extension rbeapi-puppet3-0.5.1-1.swix
  Arista# copy installed-extensions boot-extensions
  ```

# Testing

The rbeapi library provides spec tests.  To run the spec tests, you will need to
update the ``dut.conf`` file found in spec/fixtures.  The switch used for testing
should have at least interfaces Ethernet1-7.

* To run the spec tests, run ``bundle exec rspec spec`` from the root of the
  rbeapi source folder.
